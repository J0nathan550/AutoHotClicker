# AutoHotClicker

AutoHotClicker is a no-code, visual alternative to scripting tools like AutoHotkey (AHK).  
It allows you to design complex macros and key bindings using a user-friendly interface without needing to write any code.

## ✨ Features

- 🔥 Create key bindings and macros visually
- 🖱️ No programming or scripting required
- 🎯 Simple instruction commands with loop functionality
- ⏯️ Start and pause macros with a designated key
- 🔄 Continuous execution until manually paused

## 📸 How It Works

- Assign a key to start your macro.
- Define actions visually (e.g., press key, release key, etc.).
- Configure the macro to loop continuously until paused.
